# Classes
## Card
### static
    ✓ enum Suit: {clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades}
    ✓ VALID_VALUES: String = "A23456789TJQK" *** MBR added
### fields
    ✓ value: char     - A - T (10), J - K, no Joker
    ✓ suit: Suit      - (spades ♠, hearts ♥, diamonds ♦, clubs ♣)
    ✓ errorFlag: bool - card is in illegal state
### methods
    ✓ constructor(value: char, suit: Suit) - if invalid errorFlag = true
    ✓ constructor()   - returns an Ace of Spades
    ✓ set(value: Char, suit: Suit): bool - sets suit & value, if invalid errorFlag = true
    ✓ suit, value & errorFlag accessors
    ✓ equals: bool    - true if fields equal
    ✓ toString        - { suit|value} or { INVALID } (if invalid) or { �� } *** MBR added
    ✓ private isValid(value: Char, suit: Suit): bool - check suit & value for validity

## Hand
represents the cards held by a single player
    can hold several cards
    cards are not sorted just added to the tail.
    cards are played from the tail.
        it is a stack.
    the app will implement arrange() to put the card to be played at the tail position before playCard() is called.

### static
    public MAX_CARDS: int - 100 // no 'monster arrays'
### fields
    myCards: array[Card] - //also called myArray in assignment desc
    numCards: int        - count of cards
### methods
    takeCard(): bool      - gets a card from the deck, copies card to myCards (next pos), returns true if success
    playCard(): Card       - plays a card to the table or player. removes & returns card from tail of array.
    constructor()        - default
    resetHand(): unit    - remove all cards from the hand (use simplest way)
    numCards accessor
    inspectCard(k: int): Card - returns the card at a given position or a Card with errorFlag = true if k is invalid
    toString(): String   - foreach card in myCards: card.toString()


## Deck
represents the source of all cards
    normally 52 cards (4 suits * 13 values)
    dealt cards
    player taken cards after the deal.
### static
    public MAX_CARDS: int   - 6 * 52 // six packs
    masterPack: array[Card] - all the standard cards for a pack
    private allocateMasterPack(): unit - if masterPack is empty, populate it.

### fields
    cards: array[Card] - array of cards in this deck
    numPacks: int      - number of packs in this deck
    topCard: int       - position of the top card in the array (basically numCards)
### methods
    constructor(numPacks: int) - numPacks * standard-deck(52 cards: 4 suits * 13 values)
    dealCard(): Card   - removes the card at topCard's position from cards & returns it.
    shuffle(): unit    - randomly reorders the cards array
    init(numPacks: int): unit - resets deck with numPacks fresh packs
    init(): unit       - resets deck with self.numPacks fresh packs
    private swap(cardA: int, cardB: int): unit - switches 2 cards at given positions *** MBR added
    topCard accessor
    inspectCard(k: int): Card - returns the card at a given position or a Card with errorFlag = true if k is invalid


## Assig3
contains everything that is needed for testing

### methods
    main() - tests
        // test Card
        init card 1 (default constructor)
        init card 2 (valid)
        init card 3 (invalid)
        print cards 1-3
        set card 2 (invalid)
        set card 3 (valid)
        print cards 1-3

        // test Hand
        init 5 valid cards
        init hand
        in a loop, takeCard for those 5 cards until Hand.MAX_CARDS met
        print hand (toString)
        inspectCard (valid)
        inspectCard (invalid)
        in a loop, until hand is empty (numCards == 0)
            playCard & print that card (toString)
        print (empty) hand (toString)

        // test Deck
        init deck with 2 packs
        in a loop, until deck is empty
            dealCard & print that card

        reset (init) deck
        shuffle deck
        in a loop, until deck is empty
            dealCard & print that card

        reset (init) deck with 1 pack
        in a loop, until deck is empty
            dealCard & print that card

        reset (init) deck
        shuffle deck
        in a loop, until deck is empty
            dealCard & print that card

        // test Deck + Hand
        ask user for # of players (1-10), until valid
        new deck with 1 pack
        deal cards among the hands until deck is empty
        for each hand, display their contents.

        reset the deck
        reset each hand

        shuffle the deck
        deal cards among the hands until deck is empty
        

# functionality
use a deck to deal Hand objects to players
dealer may or may not be a player who gets a hand

# pre-submit check
always call accessors & mutators -- even from within the class
all mutators return bool

# submit
Submit only one .txt file that has all classes and output.
duplicate among teammates
